This project must be opened in Xcode.

Admittedly, the code could be cleaned up a good amount. Most of the code in my fetchData function should be modularized so it doesn't look as messy. 
However, the code runs well and I believe everything works as expected.

Some cool features:
  - score is tracked in real time
  - correct answer button lights up green, incorrect user answer button lights up red
  - "play again" button only appears at end of round, the rest of the buttons become disabled at this time
  - game completely reset when "play again" button is tapped
