# TandemTrivia

This project must be opened in Xcode. You should be able to simply clone a new project and use the ssh provided by github.

Admittedly, the code could be cleaned up a good amount. Most of the code in my fetchData function should be modularized so it doesn't look as messy. 
However, the code runs well and I believe everything works as expected.

Some cool features:
  - score is tracked in real time
  - after user selects an answer, correct answer lights up in green and incorrect answer (if selected) lights up in red
  - "play again" button only appears at end of round, the rest of the buttons become disabled at this time
  - game completely reset when "play again" button is tapped
